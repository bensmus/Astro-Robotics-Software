OBSTACLE CREATION TECHNIQUE
1.  Choose "n" random points in the worldsize
2.  Create bounding rectangles for all "n" points
3.  Do a chain circle growing technique from the middle until we create a bulbuous shape that touches the bounding rectangle,
    or until 5 iterations
'''

# Version 1 simplifies this obstacle creation technique, to have all obstacles be rectangles.
